Exercise 1: max_bright = 600 and min_bright = 47000, we found these values to give us a duty cycle of about 0 when it was very dark and a duty cycle of 1 when very bright based on the equation given. When it was very dark the photocell value was about 47000 which with the min_bright value would be 0 in the numerator which means the LED should be off the whole time. When it was very bright the photocell value was about 600 which made the duty cycle 1, leaving it on constantly
